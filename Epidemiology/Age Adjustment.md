Calcualting age adjustment by using age adjustment weight vs. age adjustment by population
* https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt20.pdf

My analysis is stored on Google Sheets. I was able to reproduce the results from the published paper. However, depending on the age distributions (number of age group categories used to calculate the age adjustment analysis) even if a standard population is used, the age adjustment results can differ which means there needs to be a standard for the age adjusted age groups.
